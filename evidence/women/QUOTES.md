# Not ordered in any way

* Some woman walked past and yelled "nei nei weg weg" into my face as if I am some sort of dog. Then she told the next car to drive past very loudly to scare me. As if anyone would care about that.
* Women refuse to serve others in restaurants, bars and elsewhere
* Women have sneezed into my face on the streets, coughed into my face, abused and have thrown insults at me on the streets, everywhere, constantly
